<h1>Maps and Cartography</h1>

<h3>This section covers conventions for map and cartographic design. Here, you will learn about design principles and choices for making what is considered a good map. Examples include ways to organize the elements of the map, structuring data, and color and shape choices for telling different stories with the data.</h3>

<h2>Basic Principles of Graphic Design: The C.R.A.P. Principle</h2>

The abbreviation **C.R.A.P.** stands for *contrast*, *repetition*, *alignment*, and *proximity*.<sup>[1]</sup>

> **Constrast** refers to a state of things being different, for example, the colors red and green. This makes things stand out, which helps users know where to look first.

>**Repetition** refers to consistent elements, for example repeat color choices and bulleted lists when items can be naturally listed. This provides a cohesive look.

>**Alignment** refers to structuring elements into columns and ordering objects. This provides an easy-to-read profile.

>**Proximity** refers the closeness of elements that are associated and/or related.

<h2>Tuft's Principles of Graphical Excellence</h2>

1. Show the data.
2. Induce the reader to think about the substance, not the methodology, graphic design, or technology used.
3. Avoid distorting what the data says. Graphic design choices are important to conveying the story you want, but can easily disrupt the true meaning if poor choices are made.
4. Present many numbers in a small space.
5. Make large datasets coherent.
6. Encourage the eye to compare. Show enough data to make your point, but not too much as to distract the reader.
7. Stay integrated with statistical and verbal descriptions of a dataset.

<h2>Basic Principles of Creating Effective Maps</h2>

A geographic information system (GIS) is the best way to create ugly maps fast.

Some scientific rules, but with artistic judgement: about colors, symbology, labels, layout, selection of data, projection, scale, etc.

<h3>Rules of Thumb for Spatial Data</sup></h3>

These are a few points regarding rules of thumb for spatial data.<sup>[2]</sup> The full list can be found [here](http://ibis.geog.ubc.ca/~brian/rules_of_thumb/).


> **Rules of thumb in cartography**
* Number of shades of gray distinguishable - 16 max
* Number of legend categories consistently recognized - 5, 7 max
* Symbol sizes should not vary when mapping qualitative data.
* Raw totals should not be mapped using a choropleth map.

> **Rules of thumb in GIS**
* To determine the approximate resolution of vector data, if the "scale" of the data is known -- take the 1000's units, divide by 2 to get the minimum mapping unit in meters (e.g., 1:20,000 - 20/2 - 10 m).
* The resolution of raster data is considered equal to the square root of the cell area.
* An heuristic is a rule of thumb, strategy, trick, simplification, or any other kind of device which drastically limits the search for solutions in large problem spaces.
